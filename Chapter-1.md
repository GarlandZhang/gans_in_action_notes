All zero-sum games have a Nash equilibrium, a point at which neither player can improve their situation or payoff by changing their actions. GAN reaches Nash equilibrium when the following conditions are met:

* The Generator produces fake examples that are indistinguishable from the real data in the training dataset.
* The Discriminator can at best randomly guess whether a particular example is real or fake (that is, make a 50/50 guess whether an example is real).
